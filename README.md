## Optical Path Design for a Cryo Optical Photoluminiscence Microscopy Set-up

The code written in Python on this files is thought to help with the selection of lenses and optical fibers for optical microscopy set-ups. The code permits a relatively fast way to check if certain parameters of the chosen optics are suitable for the set-up, 
as well as a calculation of focal length of the implied lenses based on the optical fibers and the particular set-up constraints. 

The two codes are to calculate the optical design of relatively independent branches of the set-up: the optical path that the light follows from the excitation source (laser coming out of an optical fiber) and exciting the sample, and the optical path
of the photoluminiscence coming out of the sample, being collected by an industrial objective and being ultimately imaged on a spectrometer and camera set-up for analysis.

The .frd files consist on simulations on the FRED Optimum ray-tracing software of certain configurations of lenses and optical fibers. This is not a free software and a license is needed to work on it.
