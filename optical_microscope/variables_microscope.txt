VARIABLES MICROSCOPE SET-UP SPYDER CODE
ALL VARIABLES ENTERED IN [mm] OR [Âºdeg]
VARIABLE NAMES FOLLOW THE STRUCTURE: element_description 

VARIABLE SUMMARY
SAMPLE 
- s_size: radius of the area of the sample that is illuminated

OBJECTIVE
- obj_tube: length of objective tube
- obj_f: focal length of the objective
- obj_ca: clear aperture of the objective 

DISTANCES
- d_obj_to_tube: distance from the objective lens to the tube lens
- d_tl1_to_tl2: distance between the telescope lenses (telescope length)
- d_total: total length of the set-up from objective lens to slit

SPECTROMETER
- spec_slit_size: half of the size of the spectrometer slit (final image cannot be bigger than that in order to image the full illuminated sample spot)

LENSES
- lens_tube_f: focal length of tube lens 
- lens_tl1_bf: back focal length of telescope lens 1
- lens_tl2_f: focal length of telescope lens 2

MAGNIFICATION
- mag_tube: magnification at the image plane of the tube lens
- mag_tl2: magnification at the image plane of the telescope (second magnification)
- mag_total: total magnification of the microscope system 

IMAGE
- image_size_imptube: image size at the image plane of the tube lens
- image_size_slit: image size at the slit of the spectrometer (check)
