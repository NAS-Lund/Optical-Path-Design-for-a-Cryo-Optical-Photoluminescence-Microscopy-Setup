VARIABLES EXCITATION PATH - ONE-LENS CONFIGURATION
ALL VARIABLES IN [mm] OR [ºdeg]
VARIABLE NAMES FOLLOW THE STRUCTURE: element_description 
CONSIDERATIONS: 
	- COLLIMATED RAYS AFTER THE COLLIMATOR - AUGMENT OF SIZE OF BEAM PER MM CALCULATED
	- FOCAL LENGTH OF THE LENS L1 MUST BE OF A REASONABLE SIZE (no more than 300mm) IN ORDER TO PREVENT ABERRATIONS 	

VARIABLE SUMMARY
SAMPLE 
- s_size: radius of the area of the sample that is illuminated

BEAM
- beam_r_coll: size of the collimated beam after the collimator assuming perfect collimation
- incr_beam_r_coll: increase in size of the collimated beam due to imperfections in the collimation 
- tan_phi: tangent of the angle that the beam makes wrt the optical axis after the focal point of L1

FIBER
- fib_rcore: radius of the optic fiber core 
- fib_na: numerical aperture of the fiber 
- fib_type: type of fiber multimode ("MM")/single mode ("SM") (STRING) - only for .txt file title

COLLIMATOR
- coll_f: focal length of the collimator
- coll_theta_div: divergence angle of the light out of the collimator (only for indication, assumed 0º for the rest of the calculations of the code)
- coll_mount: minimum distance from end of collimator to L1 (lens)
- coll_theta_measured: measured divergence angle (in degrees)
- divergence_angle ["exp"/"theo"]: option to use either experimentally measured or theoretical divergence angle from the collimator (STRING)

OBJECTIVE
- obj_tube: length of objective tube
- obj_f: focal length of the objective
- obj_ca: clear aperture S
- obj_y: size of the beam at the objective

DISTANCES 
- d_fpp: f'' on the sketches' notation. Distance from the focal point of L1 to the obj_f before the objective lens
- d_fp: f' on sketches' notation. Displacement of the focal point of the obj wrt focal plane

CONSTRAINTS
- d_fpoint_to_objlens: distance from the focal point of L1 until objective lens (f''+obj_f)
- d_l1_to_objlens: distance from the objective lens until L1 (min distance at which the first optics can be place wrt objective lens)

LENS
- l1_f: focal length of the L1 lens. If l1_f = 0, the code will calculate a new focal length. Otherwise it will check if the input focal length fullfils the set-up constraints. 
- l1_min_f: minimal focal length of L1 according to the constraints
